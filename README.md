# Excel-DashBoard-Covid
A covid report dashboard  - inverted pyramid or converging info story telling method

Data cleaning was done on two of the other files.
Automation and pivoting was also done.
The data were copy pasted from the other sheet to a new dashboard
Pivot tables were used.
The dashboards is interactive and the claculations are done in a seperate hidden sheet
it is worthy to note that, i used this notebook in tutoring so they are extra sheets used in explaining concepts
The dashboard shows information in a converging manner (inverted pyramid) -- from world wide summary to country
They are a number of buttons to select regions, country and dates.
